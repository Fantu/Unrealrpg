This browser game development began in 2007, in 2010 I stopped because I was
not able to create a decent graphics.  
In these years I have given a little help to some open source projects.  
I noticed the excellent quality of open source projects, the better chance
to survive and improve, so I decided to release this project as open source.


More informations
-----------------

Was developed with comments and main language in italian.  
Only when I decided to make it opensource I start to write in english
and make some documentation.  
There is a partial game english translation under docs/locale did with
Pootle and translate toolkit.  
If someone want help this project can do a pull request or "open an issue"
on github for make a question, make a report or open a discussion.  
A testing game server updated from repository is available here:

Contribute
----------

Anyone can contribute and not only with code.  
For example documentation and english translation, testing, reporting issue, suggest improvements ecc.  
The english translation is partial and probably not good because of my bad knowledge of english.  
Documentation is poor, because started only recently and also in this case probably not with good english.  
About source code there is a discussion open about coding style to define and use in this project:
