This browser game development began in 2007, in 2011 I left because I was
not able to create a decent graphics.
In these years I have given a little help to some open source projects.
I noticed the excellent quality of open source projects, the better chance
to survive and improve, so I decided to release this project as open source.


More information
----------------

Was developed with comments and main language in italian.
Only when I decided to make it opensource I start to write in english
and make some documentation.
There is a partial game english translation under docs/locale did with
Pootle and translate toolkit.
If someone want help this project can do a pull request or "open an issue"
on github for make a question, make a report or open a discussion.
