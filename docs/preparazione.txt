Set config.php in game/inclusi using config-example.php

Give full permissions to log, cache and report folders (chmod 777) to make possible on both ftp and webserver:
game/inclusi/log/
game/inclusi/log/report/
admin/cache/
Create log files and subfolders needed from command "Controlla i file log di sistema" in admin panel.
These folders are not accessible from web (deny with htaccess).

Create cronjobs:
# AUTO (needed for many game functions)
* * * * * /usr/bin/lynx > /dev/null -dump http://<website>/<subfolder>/game/AUTO.php?code=<$scripts_se_code>
# BACKUPDB (optional, data setting may be changed, backup of db with this script or in other way is highly recommended)
32 3 * * * /usr/bin/lynx > /dev/null -dump http://<website>/<subfolder>/admin/backupdb.php?code=<$scripts_se_code>

Create administration database (unique)
- create unrealrpg_1000 db with utf8_unicode_ci collation
- load docs/sql/admin.sql in it
- create first admin record:
INSERT INTO `unrealrpg_1000`.`utenti` ( `id` , `username` , `password` , `email` , `admin` , `language` )
VALUES ( NULL , '<username>', '<password>', '<mail>', '1', '<language>' );
# change <username> and <mail>, <language> is 'it' or 'en' and password is md5sum of password

Create game db with utf8_unicode_ci collation (one for each reign)
- create unrealrpg_<id> db, where <id> must be the same of $game_server array in config.php for selected reign
- load docs/sql/reign.sql in it
- change the values of config table record:
UPDATE `config` SET `id` = '<id>', `maxutenti` = '<maxusers>', `language` = '<language>' WHERE `config`.`id` =0;
# change <id>, <maxusers> and <language> is 'it' or 'en'
# I do not think this browser game is ready for massive use, advice for now most a few hundred users for 
# development and testing.
# For massive use is good wait to have more contents, features and better graphic.
# I'll probably increase version to 1.0 where ready for massive use.
# Thousands or more users may require a powerful web server or a cluster, further optimizations
# in the code and sql tables to improve performances.
